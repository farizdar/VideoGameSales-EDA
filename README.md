# VideoGameSales-EDA
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project in a Video Game Sales dataset (Seaborn and Matplotlib Visualization)

About
-------
This project is a pet project of mine to explore a Video Game Sales dataset that you can access from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales">link.</a>
I've done an exploration and visualization of the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn library.

</ul> 

Conclusion
-------
From my exploration, I can draw these conclusions :
<ul>
    <li>Top selling Platform is PS2, X360, and PS3.</li>
    <li>2008 is a great year for the gaming industry.</li>
    <li>Japan has an exquisite taste in gaming, as its best selling gaming Genre is Role-Playing.</li>
    <li>Nintendo and Electronic Arts have done some really good job in publishing games.</li>
    <li>Wii Sports is the highest selling game all time in 2006.</li>
    <li>For the next generation platform such as PS4, my suggestion for top publisher to make a bestselling game is to make an Action Genre game and try to target the Northern America Region as it is the biggest market.</li>
</ul>
